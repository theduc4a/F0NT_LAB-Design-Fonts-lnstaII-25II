FontLab 8 is an integrated font editor for Mac and Windows that helps you create fonts from start to finish, from a simple design to a complex project, and brings a spark of magic into type design.


# Make world-class fonts with FontLab 8


# TURN LETTERS INTO ART

Express your imagination, prototype and experiment. Draft glyphs with bitmap autotracing and live calligraphic strokes.

‍Draw and edit beautiful, smooth, consistent glyphs in fractional or integer precision, with the help of intelligent snapping and live numeric and visual measurements.

Refine your drawings: create overlaps, simplify paths, equalize stems. Scale while keeping stroke thickness, globally adjust weight and width, find & fix imperfections.




# MAKE WORDS LOOK GOOD

Build and assemble glyphs from variable components or from self-adjusting segment or corner skins. Add accented glyphs with a simple double-click.

‍Space and kern in multi-line tabs or windows that feel like a text editor.

Add typographic smartness like ligatures, small caps, old-style numerals with automatically-generated OpenType features, and test them in the integrated state-of-the-art complex-script text engine.




# GIVE TEXT A VOICE

Explore new directions with color and variation. Extend and complete any font in FontLab, or in mix with other font editors.

Create, open, extend, test and export font families, variable OpenType fonts, color fonts and web fonts for any Unicode writing system.

Interchange with other font editing apps like FontForge, RoboFont or Glyphs. Supercharge your workflow with powerful add-ins and Python 3 scripts.
